Today I learned that Bob is trying to hide his order.
I think everything we have learned up to this point helps SQL make a little more sense.
The thing is it took me about 17 hours to get it set up and figure out the coding sequence and why I'm using SQL and VS Code, but I get all that now.
I learned to use SELECT here to select the information I wanted to see in a table and Left Join it into a table.
I think SQL isn't too bad potentially. It's sinking in, but, I was really lost at first.
I learned how to make notes in there as well --0--
                                               ()
                                               || <=== that's me balancing. I'm still standing.
